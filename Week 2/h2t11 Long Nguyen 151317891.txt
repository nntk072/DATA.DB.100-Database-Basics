Let's look at the tables in the artwork database (their creation statements and the state provided). Assume that the action rule for foreign keys is no action. Does the SQL shell execute the insert, update, or delete operation below? Briefly justify your answer.

a) Yes 
UPDATE artwork
SET artist_id = 5
WHERE artwork_id = 3;

This does not violate referential integrity as there is an artist with artist_id of 5 in the artist table.


b) No
INSERT INTO artwork
VALUES (4, 'The Fast Supper', 'painting', 500, 1498, NULL);

This violate null since artist_id is primary key, which means it is also unique.


c) No.
INSERT INTO artwork
VALUES(10, 'Monta Lisaa', 'painting', 20, 2020, 13); 

This violates referential integrity as 
- There is no artist with artist_id of 13 in the artist table
- artist_id is a foreign key column in the artwork table.

d) No
UPDATE artist
SET artist_id = 13
WHERE artist_id = 1;

This violates referential integrity as 
- artist_id in artwork is a foreign key column in the artwork table.
- The action rule for foreign keys is no action

e) No

UPDATE artist
SET artist_id = 13
WHERE artist_id = 5;

This violates referential integrity as 
- artist_id in artwork is a foreign key column in the artwork table.
- The action rule for foreign keys is no action

f) Yes
UPDATE artist
SET last_name = 'diCaprio'
WHERE artist_id = 1;

This does not violate referential integrity as there are no foreign key constraints that reference the last_name column in the artist table.

g) No
DELETE FROM artist
WHERE artist_id = 2;

This violates referential integrity as 
- artist_id in artwork is a foreign key column in the artwork table. We can't update or delete the artist_id in artist table.
- The action rule for foreign keys is no action

h) No
INSERT INTO displayed_at
VALUES (4, 2);

In displayed_at, we already had (4,2). And artwork_id and exhibition_id in displayed_at is primary key, which means it is also unique

i) Yes
UPDATE displayed_at
SET artwork_id = 3
WHERE artwork_id = 1 AND exhibition_id = 1;

Since there are no foreign key constraints on displayed_at reference both artwork and exhibition, there are no violations for updating
